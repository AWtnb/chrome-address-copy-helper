# README

Add a context menu to copy Japanese address as postalcode separated with tab.

## Features

- Full width numbers and aplhabets are coverted to half width.
- Works only on HTTPS sites.
- It does not matter whether the address is real or not. Postalcode-splitting is by a regular expression.
