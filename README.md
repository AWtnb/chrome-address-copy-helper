## Features

**Add a context menu to copy Japanese address as postalcode separated with tab.**

- Full width numbers and aplhabets are coverted to half width.
- Automatically trim the first postalcode symbol U+3012 (`ã€’`).
- Horizontal bars between numbers are automatically converted to U+002D (`-`)
- Works only on HTTPS sites.
- It does not matter whether the address is real or not. Postalcode is splitted by regular expression.
